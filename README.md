As a newbie data analyst I wanted to get my hands dirty on more projects after my first project on data cleaning, 
so I took it upon myself to work on the covid-19 dataset. I used SQL server as a tool. Let me introduce the dataset. 
The dataset was gotten from [link](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
