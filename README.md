# Data-exploration-on-Covid-dataset

## 1. Introduction
---

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has had a profound impact on global health, economies, and societies. Since its emergence in late 2019, the virus has spread rapidly across the globe, leading to millions of deaths and significant disruptions to daily life. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020, and efforts to contain the virus have since been at the forefront of global health initiatives.

Presently the impacts of COVID-19 in daily life are extensive and have far reaching consequences.

In this project, I analyzed and explored covid data with SQL using Micrsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

Let me introduce the dataset. 
The dataset was gotten from [ this link](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). it was sourced from  starting from 1st January, 2020 to 5th November, 2022.

I had to split the dataset into two sections called covid deaths and covid vaccinations for easy exploration.
